Hello Wonderful CS106Bers!

Unfortunately, it seems like a recent update to Qt Creator has broken the ability of
Qt Creator to play sounds. I managed to hack around this in lecture by writing C++
code that used an auxiliary library I have installed on my machine to play sounds.
However, since I'm using a Linux system, I don't think that solution will work
on other operating systems. As a result, this version of the looper just prints
out which notes it would play, rather than actually playing them. :-(

If I can find a fix for this, I'll update these starter files.

Sorry about that!
