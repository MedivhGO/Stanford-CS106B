Sound files were taken from the University of Iowa:

    http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html
    
These files were converted to .wav format, trimmed in length, and
edited to remove leading silence.

Clap.wav sound effect taken from

    http://dight310.byu.edu/media/audio/FreeLoops.com/1/1/909%20Clap%2002-5817-Free-Loops.com.mp3
    
and converted to a .wav file.

Silence.wav sound effect was formed by taking a .wav file and
truncating it to zero seconds.
